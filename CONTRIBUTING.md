### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Steps, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. 


<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/brittanyarima/Steps/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/brittanyarima/Steps/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behaviour** and **explain which behaviour you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots** which can help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Steps users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

- Download Xcode 15.0 or later, and macOS 14.0 or later.
- Fork the repo to your profile
- Clone to your computer
- Setup the upstream remote
  

 ```sh
git remote add upstream (https://github.com/brittanyarima/Steps.git
```

  **BEFORE** starting on an issue, comment on the issue you want to work on.
   * This prevents two people from working on the same issue. The maintainer will assign you that issue, and you can get started on it.

  * Checkout a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue:

```sh
git checkout -b issueNumber-feature-name
```
* When your feature/fix is complete open a pull request, PR, from your feature branch to the `dev` branch
* No commits should be made to the `main` branch directly. The `main` branch shall only consist of the deployed code

**New to Git?**
* Here's a great resource [Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
